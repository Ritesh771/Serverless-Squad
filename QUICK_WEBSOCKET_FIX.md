# 🔧 Quick WebSocket Fix

## ❌ Problem
You're seeing this error:
```
WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:8000/ws/status/3/customer/' failed: 
WebSocket is closed before the connection is established.
```

## ✅ Solution
You need to run Django with an **ASGI server** (not the regular Django server).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Stop Your Current Django Server
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where Django is running.

### Step 2: Start Django with ASGI Server

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
./start_server.sh
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
start_server.bat
```

**Or manually:**
```bash
daphne -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8000 homeserve_pro.asgi:application
```

### Step 3: Start Frontend (in a separate terminal)
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🎉 That's It!

Your WebSocket connections will now work. You should see in the browser console:
```
✅ WebSocket connected successfully
```

## 📚 More Details
See `WEBSOCKET_FIX_GUIDE.md` for complete documentation.

## 🔍 What Changed?
- ✅ Installed Daphne (ASGI server)
- ✅ Created start scripts
- ✅ Your WebSocket code already works correctly!

## ⚠️ Important
**Never use** `python manage.py runserver` **if you need WebSockets**.
Always use `./start_server.sh` or the Daphne command.
